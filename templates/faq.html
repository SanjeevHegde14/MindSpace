                    Is the report a medical diagnosis?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    No. MindSpace is a technical demonstration and educational tool only.
                    The results are statistical indicators based on language patterns and
                    should <strong>never</strong> be treated as a medical, psychological,
                    or clinical diagnosis. For any mental health concerns, always consult
                    a qualified professional.

                    What data is stored?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you are logged in, MindSpace stores the full analysis result in the
                    SQLite database linked to your user account. This can include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyzed post texts retrieved during that session</li>
                    <li>Sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral)</li>
                    <li>Abnormality/risk probability values</li>
                    <li>Summary verdict and generated statistics</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This information is stored only to provide a history view and report
                    downloads for your account.

                    Why did the chart look strange before?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In earlier versions, the results chart could appear distorted because
                    old graph data was not fully cleared before redrawing. This was
                    related to how Chart.js reused the existing canvas element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The issue is resolved by explicitly destroying the previous chart
                    instance and recreating the canvas on each new analysis. This ensures
                    that every result is rendered from a clean state with correct data.
